## Week 10 – Day 1: Node.js Refresher

### What I learned
- Node.js is event-driven and lightweight
- Cloud apps should be stateless
- Applications listen on ports and are controlled by Security Groups
- Environment variables are used for configuration

### AWS Architecture Insight
- Stateless Node apps work well with ALB + Auto Scaling Groups
- Fast startup enables horizontal scaling
- Configuration should not be hardcoded

### Next Step
- Build Express API for scalable deployment
