# Week 6 Day 2 – Subnet Automation

## What I built
- Python script to create public and private subnets inside a VPC
- Automated tagging of subnets

## Key concepts
- Subnets divide a VPC CIDR
- CIDR planning for public vs private
- Availability Zones
- Reusing existing infrastructure IDs

## DevOps insight
Infrastructure components are layered: VPC → Subnets → Routing.
Automation must respect dependencies.
