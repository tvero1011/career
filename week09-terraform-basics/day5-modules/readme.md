# Week 9 Day 5 – Terraform Modules & Best Practices

## What Is a Module?
A Terraform module is a reusable collection of infrastructure resources that improves consistency and scalability.

## Why Modules Matter
Modules prevent duplicated code and enable standardized infrastructure across environments.

## Module Structure
Modules typically include main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf.

## Best Practices
- Small, focused modules
- Variables for configurability
- Minimal outputs
- No hard-coded secrets

## SAA Perspective
Modules enable repeatable, predictable infrastructure changes and support large-scale architectures.
