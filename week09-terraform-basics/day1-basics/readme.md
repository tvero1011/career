## What I Built
- Provisioned EC2 using Terraform
- Used declarative IaC approach

## Terraform Workflow
- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
- terraform destroy

## Architecture (SAA Perspective)
- IaC ensures consistency and repeatability
- Terraform prevents configuration drift
- Enables automated infrastructure deployments

## Exam Relevance
Terraform is ideal when:
- Managing infrastructure at scale
- Supporting CI/CD pipelines
- Ensuring auditable infrastructure changes
