# Week 7 — Day 1: CI/CD Fundamentals

## What is CI/CD?
CI/CD is a DevOps practice where code changes automatically trigger testing, validation, or deployment processes.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- Runs automatically when code is pushed
- Checks if code works
- Prevents broken code from being merged

## Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)
- Automatically runs scripts or deploys systems
- Removes manual execution
- Ensures repeatability

## Why CI/CD matters
- Reduces human error
- Improves reliability
- Enables automation at scale

## CI/CD in my Career C course
I will use GitHub Actions to run Python automation scripts and later deploy infrastructure to AWS.
