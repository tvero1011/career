## ⚙️ Python Automation via CI/CD

This project demonstrates how Python automation scripts can be executed automatically using GitHub Actions.

### Pipeline Flow
1. Code is pushed to the repository
2. GitHub Actions provisions a Linux runner
3. Python environment is installed
4. Dependencies are resolved
5. Automation script is executed automatically

This mirrors real-world DevOps pipelines where infrastructure checks and scripts run continuously without manual intervention.
