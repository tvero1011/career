# Week 7 — CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## What I built
- Automated CI pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Linting with flake8
- Unit testing with pytest
- Quality gates that block broken code

## Why this matters
This pipeline ensures only clean, tested code is merged,
similar to real-world DevOps workflows.

## Tools used
- GitHub Actions
- Python 3.10
- pytest
- flake8
