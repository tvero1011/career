## 📌 Why This Pipeline Matters

This CI/CD pipeline demonstrates how automation removes manual execution from software workflows.

Instead of running scripts manually:
- Code changes trigger pipelines automatically
- Environments are created consistently
- Errors are detected early
- Automation becomes repeatable and auditable

This reflects real-world DevOps practices used in production systems.
