## 🚀 Automated Deployment (CI/CD)

This repository demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Deployment Flow
1. Developer pushes code to `main`
2. GitHub Actions runner starts automatically
3. Static site is packaged and deployed to GitHub Pages
4. Changes go live without manual intervention

This mirrors real-world continuous deployment practices used in production environments.
