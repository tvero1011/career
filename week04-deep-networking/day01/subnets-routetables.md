# **Week 4 — Day 1

### Subnets + Route Tables (VPC Deep Dive)**

## 1. Overview

Today you will configure a more advanced VPC layout.
You will create public and private subnets, associate route tables, and understand how traffic flows inside AWS networking.

This is foundational for the ALB + ASG integration coming later this week.

## 2. Architecture for Today

Your target layout:

VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
│
├── Public Subnet 1 (10.0.1.0/24)
├── Public Subnet 2 (10.0.2.0/24)
│     └── Uses Route Table → Internet Gateway
│
├── Private Subnet 1 (10.0.3.0/24)
└── Private Subnet 2 (10.0.4.0/24)
      └── Uses Route Table → NAT Gateway (Week 4 Day 2)


Today you build:
VPC
4 subnets
Route table for public subnets
Route table for private subnets
Attachments & associations

## 3. Actions Performed

### 3.1 Create VPC
Go to VPC Console
Create VPC
Name: week4-vpc
IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
Tenancy: Default

### 3.2 Create Subnets
Public Subnets
Name	AZ	CIDR
public-subnet-1	ap-southeast-1a	10.0.1.0/24
public-subnet-2	ap-southeast-1b	10.0.2.0/24
Private Subnets
Name	AZ	CIDR
private-subnet-1	ap-southeast-1a	10.0.3.0/24
private-subnet-2	ap-southeast-1b	10.0.4.0/24

### 3.3 Create Route Tables
Public Route Table
Name: public-rt
Associate to:
public-subnet-1
public-subnet-2

Add route:
0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (IGW attached later)

Private Route Table
Name: private-rt
Associate to:
private-subnet-1
private-subnet-2
No outbound route yet
NAT gateway will be added tomorrow (Week 4 Day 2)

### 3.4 Attach Internet Gateway
Create IGW: week4-igw
Attach to week4-vpc
Add route to public route table
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: Internet Gateway (week4-igw)

## 4. Verification Steps

Verify VPC & CIDR
VPC: 10.0.0.0/16

Verify Subnets
Public: 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
Private: 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24

Public Subnets → IGW
Private Subnets → no outbound internet yet

Everything should match this:
Public RT → IGW
Private RT → (empty for now)

## 5. What You Learned Today

How to design proper VPC CIDR blocks
Differences between public vs private subnets
How route tables control traffic
How IGW enables internet access
