# Week 8 Day 1 – Containers Fundamentals (Docker + AWS Context)

## Key Concepts
- Containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel
- Docker packages applications into portable containers
- Containers start faster and use fewer resources than VMs

## AWS Context (SAA)
- ECS: AWS-native container orchestration
- EKS: Kubernetes on AWS
- Fargate: Serverless containers (no EC2 management)

## Commands Used
- docker version
- docker run hello-world
- docker ps -a
- docker images

## Why This Matters
Containers are foundational for modern cloud architectures, CI/CD pipelines, and are heavily tested in the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam.
